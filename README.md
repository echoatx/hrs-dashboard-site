## **Environment Variables**

The following table of environment variables is only useful for
developers and webmasters. You should ignore it. It is provided for
assistance with reproducibility by ensuring the information which may be
useful is not only logged in some cloud storage (Onedrive) but also
stored transparently in this location, guaranteeing the values here are
not out of sync with what (may have) affected the rendering process for
the live website.

<details>
<summary> These are all the environment variables that were active when this dashboard was rendered by <a href="https://quarto.org/">Quarto</a>.</summary>
