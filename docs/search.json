The data sources for the dashboard are:\n\nExports from the Homeless Management Information System (HMIS), a database that service providers use to record data collected when providing services to people experiencing homelessness.\nCapacity updates that programs submit to ECHO on an annual and a quarterly basis.\nThe annual Homeless Inventory Count (HIC).\n\nThe dashboard contains data on key performance measures and system flow through the pathways clients take from homelessness to housing. Metrics included in the Dashboard can help answer the following kinds of questions:\n\nWhat is the current capacity of the system and how has that changed over time?\nHow many people are moving into Rapid Re-Housing and Permanent Supportive Housing per month and how has that changed over time?\nHow many people are estimated to be experiencing unsheltered and sheltered homelessness at points in time?\nWhat kinds of programs are people enrolling in?\nHow do all the above metrics differ by race/ethnicity and household type?\n\nThe dashboard is updated monthly. Answers to the above questions can be used to track progress, understand pain points, set continuous improvement goals, and secure additional resources for the HRS.\n\n\nNot sure where to start? Click here for an intro to navigating the dashboard.\n\n\nThe summary circles for the number of people likely experiencing homelessness and the number of people that took a coordinated assessment in the past twelve months have been removed from this index page while under maintenance."

    "text": "Definitions & Program Types\n\nBy-name list (BNL):\nA list of all heads of household who have entered the Homelessness Response System, completed a Coordinated Assessment (CA), and are either on a prioritization or program referral list. The BNL is updated daily by ECHO and service provider staff. People come off the list when they have moved into housing, a staff member knows they have found permanent housing on their own, or ECHO and service providers think, with reasonable certainty, are no longer experiencing homelessness in Austin / Travis County (e.g., the client left the area, entered long-term medical institutionalization or incarceration, or has passed away).\n\n\nChronic:\nThe number of people experiencing the government’s definition of “chronic homelessness.” Chronicity, as defined by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), means a person with a disability has been living in a place not meant for human habitation, a safe haven, and/or emergency shelter for at least 12 consecutive months, or on at least four separate occasions in the last 3 years where the combined occasions total a length of time of at least 12 months.\n\n\nCoordinated Assessment (CA):\nThe vulnerability index tool used by the Homelessness Response System to prioritize individuals and families most in need of housing services. The assessment is administered by trained direct service staff across various community service providers. Once assessed, households are referred to the programs they qualify for.\n\n\nCoordinated Entry:\nThe Homelessness Response System’s consolidated housing application process whereby anyone experiencing homelessness in Austin / Travis County can apply for all possible housing programs at the same time and get the same answer about all immediate and future program openings.\n\n\nES - Emergency Shelter:\nProjects that offer temporary shelter for those experiencing homelessness. Services and benefits are designed to orient and support people to connect to permanent housing.\n\n\nFamily:\nThe number of people living in a household with at least two members and at least one person under the age of 18.\n\n\nMinimal Housing Assistance (MHA):\nSupport services designed to assist individuals with low housing barriers or persons likely to self-resolve their homelessness.\n\n\nPrioritization List:\nA list of heads of household who completed a CA and have expressed a need for a permanent housing (PH) program intervention—either Rapid Re-Housing (RRH) or Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH)—but have not been connected to a specific program yet. Some people on this list are waiting for RRH, some for PSH, and others for either.\n\n\nProgram referral list:\nA list of heads of household who have been referred to a PH program but who have not moved into housing yet.\n\n\nPSH - Permanent Supportive Housing:\nAn evidence-based practice and permanent housing intervention for persons with a disability that includes ongoing rental subsidy and offers intensive support services throughout program participation.\n\n\nRRH - Rapid Re-Housing:\nA short-term permanent housing intervention that includes housing locations services, rental assistance not to exceed 24 months, and housing-focused case management.\n\n\nSH - Safe Haven:\nProjects that offer supportive housing to people experiencing homelessness with severe mental illness who are otherwise not accessing housing programs in the system.\n\n\nTH - Transitional Housing:\nProjects that provide temporary lodging and are designed to help those experiencing homelessness move into permanent housing within a specified period of time (no longer than 24 months).\n\n\nUnsheltered at Entry:\nThe number of people who entered a Permanent Housing program from an unsheltered living situation.\n\n\nYouth:\nThe number of people who live in households that are headed by someone under the age of 25."

In addition to returning to this table of contents, you can go to any of the main sections of the dashboard (such as “System Capacity”) by clicking there. The top navigation bar also contains:\n\nECHO’s social media links under the “thumb’s up” icon toward the right (click the icon to expand the menu).\nLinks to the FAQ, Data Requests, and Media Requests sections of the ECHO website under the “envelope” icon toward the right (click the icon to expand the menu).\nA search box feature that allows you to search for specific content anywhere in the dashboard. Click the magnifying glass icon to open the search box.\n\nThis quick navigation page also has an expandable navigation bar on the left-hand side of the page that shows the more detailed contents of each of the sections. Clicking “System Capacity” in this left-hand sidebar will expand the System Capacity contents to let you see what’s on that page, and you can click on a specific element (such as the Organization Capacity Chart) to go directly there.\nThe left-hand navigation bar will not be present on the dashboard sections. Instead you will see an “On This Page” box on the right side of the page that shows you the contents of that specific section. It will highlight the subsection you’re in, and you can click on other subsections to jump directly there. The “On this Page” box will have a “Toggle Focus Mode” button like the blue and yellow button below, which will take that page into fullscreen mode while you’re viewing it.\nAt the bottom right of this page you can see there is a forward link that will take you to the next section (“System Capacity”). As you move through the sections of the dashboard you will be able to move forward and back a section at a time with these back/forward navigation links at the bottom left/right of each section.\n\nToggle Focus Mode   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext: System Capacity"
