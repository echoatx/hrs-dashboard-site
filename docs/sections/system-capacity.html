<p><strong>Note:</strong> Prior to 2021, BSS+ capacity was all counted under Caritas of Austin in their role as the lead BSS+ funding recipient and coordinating agency. Beginning in 2021, BSS+ capacity started being counted under the individual BSS+ participating subrecipient agencies. This shows up as a decrease in Caritas capacity and an increase in other BSS+ participant capacities.</p>
