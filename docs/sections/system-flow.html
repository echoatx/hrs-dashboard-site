All time measures reported are median (the 50th percentile) number of days rather than averages, to account for outliers that would otherwise skew averages.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="details"><strong>Coordinated Entry Flow Details</strong></h2>
<p>The following figures show how long people take to go through the CE process, broken down by race/ethnicity, household type, age group, and project type. All time measures reported are median (the 50th percentile) number of days rather than averages, to account for outliers that would otherwise skew averages.</p>
<p>For the race/ethnicity plots, we only include numbers for Black, non-Hispanic White, and Hispanic/Latino clients, because the numbers for other race/ethnicity groups (often fewer than 10 per month) are too low and possibly misleading.</p>
<p>For more information on all these measures, see the <a href="../sections/more-info.html">More Info</a> page.</p>
